# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Zero-to-Hero

I have completed the "Zero to Hero for Natural Language Processing Using TensorFlow" course taught by Tensorflow developer advocate Laurence Moroney.
These are the codes I created while taking this lesson on YouTube. The four subjects addressed in each notebook are as follows:

1. Tokenization

2. Sequencing

3. Training a model to recognize sentiment in text

4. ML with Recurrent Neural Networks
